# Initial Skill Creation

This phase is characterised by the steps needs to be done by the developer to start the development (which skills should be developed by which people in the development team of the 3rd party).

Before you can start developing a skill as a 3rd party developer, you should make sure that you have access to the following:

## Prerequisites

* An invitation to the IBS. IBS is an identity management service that enables the use of SDP for skill configuration.
    * As a developer, one needs an IBS account and invitation as Skill Developer for a specific skill on SDP. SDP (Skill Development Portal)
    * If needed, Skill Developer asks the Skill Provider to create a skill (using existing global skill domain) on SDP
* Set up the companion app (Hallo Magenta) on your phone from either Google play-store or Apple store .
* CLI client for local testing - (optional but useful)

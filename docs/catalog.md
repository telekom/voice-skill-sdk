## Generally there are 2 fields in the highest structure:

* "fileVersion" (mandatory) this is a number indicating the version of the catalog. It should be increased whenever a new/changed version is published.
* "v2" (mandatory) is basically the container object for all the skill-config content. It is used to group all the currently supported contents. In the past a different structure of the skill-config was used and to enable backward compatibility the "v2" container was used to promote the new structure to new app versions. Today apps that use the old structure are not running at customer devices. That is why the old structure is not needed to be in the catalog.json anymore.
